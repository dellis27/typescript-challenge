# Typescript Challenge

This is my submission for the Challenge-09 Typescript Assignment.

## Installation
<br>Node.js is required for this application to work. 
<br>If that is installed, download all files underneath "srcs". 
<br>If Node is not installed, follow the instructions on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install Node. Then procede with the srcs download. 
<br>Install all the node dependancies by opening a terminal into the folder, and running:
```bash
npm i 
```
## Usage
This application is used to perform actions on vehicles, either preloaded or created through the application.
<br>Use to start the application:
 ```bash
 npm start
